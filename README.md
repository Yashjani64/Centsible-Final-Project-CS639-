   Numerous students encounter challenges in effectively managing their daily expenses due to limited resources. 
   To address this issue, the app offers a valuable tool that can help students cultivate good financial practices, 
   enabling them to make informed decisions about their finances. With the app, students can avoid financial stress

4)  What similar apps exist on the market? (at least 2 apps with names, screenshots, links,  descriptions and how different they are from what you want to do)

   GRUBIFY APP

5)  How is your app unique?

    The distinctiveness of this application lies in its multifaceted approach. It not only furnishes data about meal plans and food costs but also creates 
    reports on expenditure and proposes methods to save money. Furthermore, it calculates the daily budget based on the current balance and presents alternate 
    food options. The primary goal of this app is to aid all students in managing their finances effectively, regardless of whether they are undergraduates or not. 
    Additionally, it integrates with calorie-tracking  to provide recommendations based on the user's calorie goals. This functionality can assist students 
    in making more knowledgeable decisions about their dietary intake.

6)  What are the risks associated with the development of this app? Why wouldn’t it be delivered completely (scope), on time and on budget? Identify 3 to 5 risks that are relevant in your case.
   
   To display alternative food suggestions.
   To keep track of their Calories.
   To see the final calculation of daily, monthly and total balance after the checkout.
   Take input of Monthly goal
   Take input of Calories goal
   To change the color of the monthly spending section according to goal.

7)  What is your (personal) goal with this project? (build portfolio/resume, get experience in mobile app dev …)

    My goal is to create a highly beneficial mobile app that assists students in managing their finances effectively while also providing support for meal planning, 
    catering not only to undergraduates but all students. I aim to achieve this by generating spending reports and suggesting cost-cutting measures. 
    I intends to work to gain experience in mobile app development, brainstorming on potential challenges that  may encounter along the way.
